      "U.S. inflation is moderating, but shelter costs and tariff uncertainty could keep core inflation sticky.\n",
      "After cutting interest rates in 2024 and 2025, the Federal Reserve may cut rates further, though markets debate the pace.\n",
      "Investors may benefit from diversified portfolios and a long-term strategy as inflation, tariffs, and labor-market trends influence volatility and returns.\n",
      "Inflation continues to capture investor and consumer attention, especially as affordability becomes a bigger national focus. 1 The overall pace of U.S. price increases is moderating, even though the path has not been perfectly smooth. That combination – cooling trendlines with lingering uncertainties – keeps inflation at the center of market expectations.\n",
      "Where inflation stands right now\n",
      "The December year over year consumer price index (CPI) held steady at 2.7%, matching November’s reading. Higher energy prices provided some upward pressure, but easing shelter inflation helped offset those increases. 2 Because the federal government shutdown interrupted October data, near-term comparisons may look noisier than usual, though the distortion should fade as more consistent reporting resumes.\n",
      "Why investors watch CPI\n",
      "CPI captures the prices consumers pay across a broad basket, so it often shapes headlines and expectations. The chart below illustrates the trailing 12-month CPI rate over time to show how inflation momentum has shifted. That longer view matters because inflation trends often influence interest rates, valuations, and investor sentiment more than any single monthly CPI data release.\n",
      "Source: U.S. Bank Asset Management Group Research, Bloomberg; December 31, 2015-December 31, 2025.\n",
      "Core CPI, shelter costs and “sticky” inflation\n",
      "Food and energy prices can swing sharply, so many economists and market professionals follow core inflation measures (which exclude food and energy costs) to understand underlying trend pressure. In December, the 12-month core CPI stayed flat at 2.6%, comparable to November’s reading, suggesting steady progress rather than a renewed surge. 2 Even so, shelter remains a key “sticky” component, with shelter costs up 3.4% year-over-year and representing more than one-third of the CPI goods and services basket. 2\n",
      "Shelter inflation often cools slowly because it reflects leases and housing dynamics that reset over time, not instantly. That persistence can prevent core inflation from falling quickly when home prices and apartment rents remain stable or fall. We anticipate this dynamic will likely place modest downward pressure on inflation in 2026. Items excluding food, energy and shelter decelerated to 2.2% year-over-year from 2.3% at the beginning of 2025, reinforcing the idea that shelter is keeping inflation readings elevated. 2\n",
      "Source: U.S. Bank Asset Management Group Research, Bloomberg; May 30, 2021 – November 30, 2025.\n",
      "PCE inflation and what the Fed targets\n",
      "A second key inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price Index, rose to 2.8% year-over-year in September, up 0.1% from August. Core PCE (excluding food and energy) slowed by 0.1% to 2.8% year-over-year through September, indicating modest cooling but not a clean glide path to the Fed’s 2% inflation target. 3 Because the Federal Reserve targets PCE inflation when assessing progress toward its 2% goal, this measure often carries extra weight for monetary policy expectations. Note: more recent PCE data remains delayed due to the government shutdown. The Federal Reserve’s median projections call for Core PCE to fall to 2.5% by the end of 2026. 4\n",
      "Trump’s tariffs: What’s the impact on inflation?\n",
      "Many investors expected higher imported goods tariffs to lift prices and reignite inflation pressure. While certain categories have risen relative to pre-tariff levels – especially frequently imported goods like household furnishings and supplies – the pass through has not been as widespread as feared. “Investors watch inflation closely because of the impact on their personal budget, making tariff-related impacts a significant topic,” says Bill Merz, head of capital markets research for U.S. Bank Asset Management Group.\n",
      "“Investors are assessing what tariff rate or tariff policy duration will ultimately lead to higher prices. In other words, what’s the threshold when businesses can no longer avoid passing on higher tariff costs to consumers?”\n",
      "- Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist for U.S. Bank Asset Management Group\n",
      "Inflation peaked at above 9% in June 2022 and has trended lower since, though the pace has fluctuated since September 2024. 2 President Trump's tariff plans revived inflation concerns, especially as investors assess how long tariffs might remain in place and how high effective rates could go. “Investors are assessing what tariff rate or tariff policy duration will ultimately lead to higher prices,” says Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist with U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. “In other words, what’s the threshold when businesses can no longer avoid passing on higher tariff costs to consumers?”\n",
      "How high could effective tariff rates go?\n",
      "The effective tariff rate - tariff revenue divided by imported goods values- rose from 2.5% at the start of 2025 to nearly 12% by late 2025. Recently negotiated tariff rates range from 10% to 20%, with some higher, creating a wide band of possible outcomes. 5 If negotiations fail to lower current announced tariffs, the Yale Budget Lab estimates the effective rate could reach 14% after substitution effects, which helps explain why investors remain sensitive to this variable. 6\n",
      "Sources: U.S. Bank Asset Management Group Research, Bloomberg; November 30, 2017 – November 30, 2025. Effective tariff rate = U.S. customs revenue divided by total U.S. goods imports.\n",
      "Producer prices and what they are signaling\n",
      "Producer prices can offer an early look at business cost pressures that sometimes flow into consumer prices later. The Producer Price Index rose 2.9% year-over-year in November, up slightly from October, while prices excluding food and energy rose 3% versus July’s 2.9% increase. 2 Energy price volatility and higher goods prices contributed to this acceleration, though reporting delays tied to the government shutdown complicate interpretation.\n",
      "When will the Fed cut interest rates?\n",
      "After rapidly raising interest rates in 2022 and 2023 to fight inflation, the Fed cut rates by 1.0% in late 2024 and 0.75% in late 2025. The Fed currently projects one additional rate cut in 2026, while market expectations lean towards two, underscoring how inflation and labor data could reshape the path. 4, 7\n",
      "At the conclusion of the December 2025 meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated the committee will keep evaluating the balance of risks between inflation and the labor market when considering future adjustments. 8 That framing signals that policy may respond not only to inflation progress, but also to signs of labor market cooling. The chart below compares market expectations and Fed projections, highlighting how quickly pricing can shift as new data arrives.\n",
      "Source: U.S. Bank Asset Management Group Research, Bloomberg, September 17, 2025 - October 24, 2025. Projected policy rate through 2027.\n",
      "Market concerns beyond inflation\n",
      "Inflation can drive markets, but it rarely acts along, particularly late in the economic cycle. “Markets could be sensitive to sustained, accelerating inflation,” says Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director with U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. However, Haworth also warns that inflation is not the only trigger for market volatility, adding, “Further labor market weakness may suggest higher economic slowdown odds, which would represent a material market development.”\n",
      "Even with weaker labor market data, consumer behavior remains a key stabilizer for growth expectations. “Ultimately, it comes down to what the consumer is doing, and despite weaker labor market data, consumer spending remains strong.” says Merz. When spending stays resilient, it can support corporate earnings and reduce recession fears, even as inflation and rates remain in focus.\n",
      "Portfolio perspective: stay long-term, diversify thoughtfully\n",
      "The current environment is changing quickly, especially with the evolving inflation outlook and potential impact of higher tariffs. Investors may benefit from maintaining a broadly diversified portfolio, which can include inflation-sensitive assets such as global infrastructure alongside global equities and U.S. bonds. A consistent long-term strategy typically investors best, making dramatic changes less compelling than disciplined planning that aligns with goals and risk tolerance.\n",
      "Be sure to talk with your financial professional about what steps may be most appropriate for your situation.\n",
      "FAQs\n",
      "What is the inflation rate?\n",
      "The inflation rate measures the change in living costs for the average consumer over a given period. While there are various measures of inflation, the most popular is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a measure of changes in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. The CPI inflation rate for the 12 months ending December 2025 was 2.7%. 2\n",
      "What does inflation affect?\n",
      "Higher living costs, reflected by inflation, represent a loss of purchasing power. This is an important consideration not only in your day-to-day living, but in your long-term financial planning. To improve your quality of life over time, you’ll want to see your income grow faster than the inflation rate. To retain your lifestyle in retirement, you want to be sure that income you receive from your own investments and other sources keeps pace with changes in living costs over the course of retirement. This is why inflation has such a significant impact on individuals.\n",
      "What is a high inflation rate?\n",
      "The Federal Reserve, which Congress charged with maintaining stable prices, targets a long-term inflation rate of 2%. Between 2012 and 2020, the annual inflation rate was between 0.7% and 2.3%. Since that time, inflation has been much higher. It stood at 7.0% in 2021, 6.5% in 2022 and 3.4% in 2023 before dropping to 2.9% in 2024 and 2.7% in 2025. 6 Still, the Consumer Price Index, the most commonly cited inflation measure, remains above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. 3\n",

      "Market Update: US Stocks Rise on Strong Data and Low Inflation\n",
      "\n",
      "The US stock market has risen on strong data and low inflation, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 133.37 points, or 0.4%, to close at 35,125.17, while the S&P 500 Index advanced 23.57 points, or 0.6%, to 4,061.18.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current inflation rate in the US is 2.7%, which is below the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy costs, has remained flat at 2.6% over the past month.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates by 1.0% in late 2024 and 0.75% in late 2025, and is expected to cut rates further in 2026. The Fed's median projections call for core PCE to fall to 2.5% by the end of 2026.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors are watching inflation closely, as it can have a significant impact on their personal budget and investment decisions. The current environment is changing quickly, especially with the evolving inflation outlook and potential impact of higher tariffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "To navigate this environment, investors may benefit from maintaining a broadly diversified portfolio, which can include inflation-sensitive assets such as global infrastructure alongside global equities and US bonds. A consistent long-term strategy typically serves investors best, making dramatic changes less compelling than disciplined planning that aligns with goals and risk tolerance.\n",

      "real GDP forecasted to range between 1.6% and 1.9% per year. Persistent inflation and geopolitical conflicts (20%): While our baseline remains positive, there are always downside risks to any forecast. We see risks centering around three interrelated issues: 1) geopolitical conflicts, 2) persistent inflation, and 3) financial system stress. Major conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East have been simmering for some time; either or both could flare up to a higher level. We see the most likely impact of such escalation coming in the form of higher prices of imported goods and oil. In this scenario, the price of oil spikes to around US$100 for three quarters before gradually declining. Geopolitical conflicts are not just fought with guns. The past two American administrations have used tariffs and sanctions to varying degrees as tools to influence adversaries. The use of these tools can have an impact on the prices faced by American firms and consumers. In this scenario, we model tariffs that increase the cost of imported intermediate inputs by 1% and imported final goods by a further 1%. As a result of the tariffs and the oil price shock, the Federal Reserve is driven to hike rates twice in the near term. Even with this action, CPI inflation persists above 3% until the second quarter of 2025. The latest Federal Reserve Financial Stability Report4 highlights three near-term risks to the stability of the financial system: higher-for-longer interest rates; worsening geopolitical conflict and spillovers; and strains on real-estate markets, particularly for office real estate. In line with the other assumptions outlined above, we therefore model an increase in stress in the financial system. In this scenario, GDP growth is lower than in the baseline scenario, particularly over the next two years. Growth in 2024 is 2.2%; by the following year, the tariffs are fully implemented, and growth in 2025 is just 0.6%. Growth averages 1.7% per year from 2026 to 2028. A golden era\n",

      "outlook. In this scenario, continued geopolitical conflicts and trade actions cause inflation to stay higher for longer, driving the Federal Reserve to hike rates.1 Scenarios Baseline (70%): Real GDP growth slowed overall in the first quarter of 2024, coming in very close to our previous forecast’s expectations.2 We expect GDP growth will continue to moderate through the second half of this year and the start of the next, but the story is still positive overall. Consumer spending is forecasted to rise 2.3% this year, up from the 2.2% increase in 2023. Business investment is expected to increase 3% in 2024, down from 4.5% last year. Government spending is forecasted to rise 2.5%. Given that the US economy is expected to outperform many other global economies in the short term, we forecast imports to increase 3.1% on average in 2024, while exports are predicted to rise at a slower pace of 2.4%. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation stays above the 3% threshold for the second quarter of this year before falling to 2.7% by the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve succeeds in walking the tightrope to a soft landing by cutting rates twice in the second half of 2024 and continues with cuts until reaching the neutral rate of 2.5% to 3% by 2027. Job growth slows because current levels of job formation are not sustainable, given demographics and labor force participation. As a result, the unemployment rate falls in the short term, but rises to just under 4% in 2025 before gradually declining through the rest of the forecast period. Major investments prompted by the Inflation Reduction Act provide a boost to manufacturing.3 In addition, investments in intellectual property—such as the use of AI and other novel technologies—will continue to drive growth in the business sector. Overall, we expect the US economy to post real GDP growth of 2.4% this year, but for growth to slow to 1.1% in 2025. Between 2026 and 2028, economic growth is expected to pick back up, with annual gains in\n",

      "that food prices have increased faster than other prices, and that households prioritize essentials when having to make cutbacks due to higher prices. As price levels stabilize and wages are adjusted for past inflation, this effect may recede. But, in the meantime, these distributional changes have impacts on the amount of disposable income households have to spend on other items. Share image Share twitter linkedin facebook Or copy link Copy Share image Share twitter linkedin facebook Or copy link Copy Housing Spring is typically the busiest season for the US housing market. However, with mortgage rates remaining elevated, families who can remain in place are avoiding selling their current homes as they wait for a more favorable borrowing environment, causing the inventory of existing homes to remain low and home prices to continue rising.8 According to the National Association of Realtors, the median sales price for existing homes rose 5.7% year over year in April to US$407,600, nearing the highest recorded value of US$413,800, which was reached in June 2022.9 Despite a slowdown forecasted for the near term, the good news is that high home prices should lead to higher starts as builders respond. We project over 1.4 million housing starts this year and a further 1.5 million starts in 2025. Over the longer term, housing starts are projected to move closer to 1.6 million. This level of construction is positive; after accounting for depreciation, it means the housing stock will be growing slightly faster than the total population from 2025 until the end of the forecast period. But to have a real impact on affordability, a higher proportion of these homes will need to be “starter homes” and will need to be built in the parts of the country experiencing the strongest population growth and population inflows.
