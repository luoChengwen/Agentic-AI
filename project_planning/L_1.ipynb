      "\n",
      "2. **Jane Doe (Software Engineer)**: Assigned to a majority of the development tasks (Tasks 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) since her expertise lies in coding. Each task was assigned sequentially to ensure that Jane doesn’t overlap tasks excessively, and they follow the logical progression of development.\n",
